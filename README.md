# PurrBot Image API
This API was created to provide random images.  
The reason behind this and not to just use any existing api (e.g. nekos.life) was to have more controll over the shown images.

With version 1.2.0 was this API now merged with the original PurrBotAPI to have one central API to use.

You can see the API being used by the bot [\*Purr*][purr].
